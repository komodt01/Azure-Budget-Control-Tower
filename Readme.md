# Azure Budget Control Tower

A Terraform-based infrastructure solution for automated Azure cost management and budget monitoring with real-time alerting capabilities.

## 🎯 **Business Use Case**

### **Problem Statement**
Organizations using Azure cloud services face challenges in controlling costs and preventing budget overruns. Without automated monitoring, companies can experience:
- Unexpected monthly bills exceeding budget by 20-300%
- Lack of real-time visibility into spending patterns
- Manual processes for cost tracking that delay response times
- Difficulty implementing consistent cost controls across teams

### **Solution**
The Azure Budget Control Tower provides:
- **Automated Budget Monitoring:** Real-time tracking of actual vs. forecasted spending
- **Proactive Alerting:** Email notifications at configurable thresholds (80% actual, 100% forecasted)
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Consistent deployment across environments
- **Cost Governance:** Foundation for FinOps practices and cost optimization

### **Business Value**
- **Cost Avoidance:** Prevent budget overruns through early warning system
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reduce manual cost monitoring overhead
- **Financial Governance:** Enable proactive financial planning and controls
- **Scalability:** Template for enterprise-wide cost management implementation

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

```
Azure Budget Control Tower
├── Resource Group (Organizational container)
├── Consumption Budget (Core monitoring)
├── Action Group (Alert routing)
└── Email Notifications (Stakeholder alerts)
```

### **Core Components**
- **Azure Consumption Budget:** Monitors subscription spending against defined thresholds
- **Monitor Action Group:** Routes alerts to appropriate stakeholders
- **Email Notifications:** Delivers real-time alerts for budget threshold breaches
- **Terraform Infrastructure:** Ensures consistent, repeatable deployments

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites**
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Active Azure subscription with Contributor access
- Valid email address for notifications

### **Deployment**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd azure-budget-control-tower

# Configure your settings
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
nano terraform.tfvars  # Set your email and budget amount

# Deploy infrastructure
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

### **Configuration**
Edit `terraform.tfvars`:
```terraform
budget_amount = 100                    # Your monthly budget in USD
alert_email   = "your-email@company.com"  # Notification recipient
budget_start_date = "2025-06-01T00:00:00Z"  # Budget period start
```

## 📊 **Alert Thresholds**

The system monitors two key thresholds:
- **80% Actual Spending:** Alert when real spending reaches 80% of budget
- **100% Forecasted Spending:** Alert when Azure predicts budget will be exceeded

**Example with $500 Budget:**
- Alert at $400 actual spend
- Alert when forecast predicts $500+ monthly spend

## 🔧 **Testing**

For immediate validation, set a low budget amount:
```terraform
budget_amount = 1  # $1 for immediate alert testing
```

This triggers alerts quickly, demonstrating system functionality without cost risk.

## 🏢 **Enterprise Considerations**

**Note:** This implementation demonstrates core budget control functionality. Enterprise deployments would typically include:

- **Multi-Subscription Management:** Budgets across multiple Azure subscriptions
- **Advanced Automation:** Logic Apps for automated responses (resource shutdowns, approval workflows)
- **Integration Capabilities:** Teams/Slack notifications, ITSM system integration
- **Granular Controls:** Department/project-level budgets with hierarchical alerting
- **Compliance Features:** SOX, SOC2, audit trail requirements
- **Advanced Analytics:** Cost optimization recommendations, trend analysis
- **Role-Based Access:** Different notification levels for various stakeholders

This simplified version provides the foundation that scales to enterprise requirements.

## 🛡️ **Security & Compliance**

- Infrastructure deployed with least-privilege access
- Email notifications use encrypted channels
- Budget data remains within Azure tenant boundaries
- Compliance mapping available for SOX, SOC2, GDPR requirements

## 📈 **Monitoring & Operations**

### **Verification Steps**
1. Check Azure Portal: Cost Management + Billing > Budgets
2. Verify Action Group: Monitor > Action groups
3. Test email delivery with low budget threshold

### **Maintenance**
- Review budget amounts quarterly
- Update email recipients as team changes
- Monitor alert effectiveness and adjust thresholds

## 🔄 **Cleanup**

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

See [teardown.md](teardown.md) for detailed cleanup instructions.
