# Azure Budget Management - Compliance Mapping

This document maps the Azure Budget Management module to various compliance frameworks and regulatory requirements.

## üèõÔ∏è Regulatory Compliance Overview

The Azure Budget Management module helps organizations meet various compliance requirements related to financial governance, cost transparency, and operational controls.

## üìã Compliance Framework Mapping

### SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
**Relevant Sections:** Section 302, 404, 906

| SOX Requirement | How This Module Helps | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Financial Controls** | Automated budget monitoring and alerts | Budget thresholds with action groups |
| **Management Oversight** | Executive notifications on budget overruns | Contact roles include "Owner" for leadership |
| **Documentation** | Audit trail of budget decisions and alerts | Logic App logs and Action Group history |
| **Regular Reporting** | Automated financial reporting triggers | Email notifications to FinOps teams |

**Evidence Generated:**
- Budget alert notifications (email records)
- Logic App execution history
- Action Group trigger logs
- Policy assignment audit logs

### SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2)
**Trust Service Categories:** Security, Availability, Processing Integrity

| SOC 2 Category | Control Objective | Module Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Security** | Restrict access to financial data | Key Vault for sensitive credentials, RBAC on resources |
| **Availability** | Ensure cost monitoring systems are available | Multi-region deployment capability, redundant notifications |
| **Processing Integrity** | Accurate and complete cost tracking | Azure native budget calculations, validated thresholds |
| **Confidentiality** | Protect sensitive financial information | Encrypted storage, secure webhook URLs |

**Audit Evidence:**
- Key Vault access logs
- Resource deployment templates
- Budget calculation accuracy reports
- Encryption status of storage accounts

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
**Core Functions:** Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover

| NIST Function | Subcategory | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Identify (ID)** | Asset Management | Inventory of all budget-related resources via Terraform |
| **Protect (PR)** | Access Control | RBAC policies, Key Vault access policies |
| **Detect (DE)** | Continuous Monitoring | Real-time budget threshold monitoring |
| **Respond (RS)** | Response Planning | Automated Logic App workflows for incident response |
| **Recover (RC)** | Communications | Action Groups for stakeholder notifications |

### ISO 27001 - Information Security Management
**Annex A Controls:**

| Control | Description | Module Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **A.8.1.4** | Return of assets | Automated resource cleanup via Terraform |
| **A.12.1.2** | Change management | Infrastructure as Code approach |
| **A.12.6.1** | Management of technical vulnerabilities | Regular Terraform provider updates |
| **A.16.1.2** | Reporting information security events | Budget overage alerts as security-relevant events |

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
**Relevant Articles:** Article 25 (Data Protection by Design), Article 32 (Security of Processing)

| GDPR Principle | Implementation | Technical Measures |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Minimization** | Only collect necessary financial metadata | Budget filters limit data scope |
| **Purpose Limitation** | Use data only for cost management | Clear variable descriptions and documentation |
| **Storage Limitation** | Retain logs only as needed | Configurable retention policies |
| **Security** | Encrypt sensitive data | Key Vault encryption, HTTPS endpoints |

**Personal Data Handling:**
- Email addresses in action groups (lawful basis: legitimate interest)
- Phone numbers for SMS alerts (consent required)
- No financial personal data stored directly

### PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
**Requirements 1, 2, 7, 8:** Network Security, System Configuration, Access Control

| PCI DSS Requirement | Module Compliance | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Req 1: Firewall Configuration** | Network segmentation for budget resources | VNet integration capability |
| **Req 2: Default Passwords** | No default credentials used | Managed identities, secure Key Vault |
| **Req 7: Access Control** | Restrict budget data access | RBAC implementation |
| **Req 8: User Authentication** | Secure authentication to resources | Azure AD integration |

## üîí Security Controls Implementation

### Access Controls
```terraform
# Example: Restrictive RBAC policy
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "budget_reader" {
  scope                = data.azurerm_subscription.current.id
  role_definition_name = "Cost Management Reader"
  principal_id         = var.budget_team_object_id
}
```

### Encryption
- **At Rest:** Key Vault secrets, Storage Account encryption
- **In Transit:** HTTPS for all webhook communications
- **Key Management:** Azure-managed keys with option for customer-managed keys

### Monitoring and Logging
```terraform
# Enable diagnostic settings for audit trails
resource "azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting" "budget_diagnostics" {
  name               = "budget-audit-logs"
  target_resource_id = azurerm_consumption_budget_subscription.main_budget.id
  
  log_analytics_workspace_id = var.log_analytics_workspace_id
  
  log {
    category = "Administrative"
    enabled  = true
  }
}
```

## üìä Compliance Reporting

### Automated Reports
The module can generate compliance reports for:
- Budget threshold breaches
- Action taken on overages
- Access control changes
- Resource configuration drift

### Audit Trail Components
1. **Budget Creation/Modification:** Terraform state files
2. **Alert Triggers:** Action Group execution logs
3. **Automated Responses:** Logic App run history
4. **Access Changes:** Azure Activity Log
5. **Configuration Changes:** Resource Manager deployment history

## üîç Regular Compliance Checks

- [ ] Budget threshold effectiveness
- [ ] Email delivery success rates
- [ ] Logic App execution success
- [ ] Access control assignments

### Quarterly Assessments

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal and Regulatory Considerations

### Data Residency
- **Budget Data:** Stored in Azure region specified in `location` variable
- **Notifications:** Email/SMS routing may cross borders
- **Logs:** Retention follows Azure service default policies

### Data Subject Rights (GDPR)
- **Right to Access:** Contact lists accessible via Terraform state
- **Right to Rectification:** Update email/SMS receivers in variables
- **Right to Erasure:** Remove from notification lists, purge Key Vault
- **Right to Portability:** Export Terraform configurations
